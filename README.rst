A Personal Finance CLI
======================
This is a command line interface which performs some basic tasks
that a Personal Finance Management application would, such as
allowing you to view account balances and transaction history.
You can also import banking information from CSV files, currently
only in the formats provided by two US banks though.

For now, if you want to use this you will have to provide your own
categories and second parties using a means outside of the
command line interface provided. Accounts and Transactions can
be created from the command line.

A Note
------
In addition to the use this has on its own merits, this project
is being used to see how breezeblocks_ feels to use in the real
world. To that end, at least for the time being, the version
of breezeblocks used in this program may sometimes be a version
that has not been released to PyPI but is in the breezeblocks
git repository, though this will be avoided as much as possible.
